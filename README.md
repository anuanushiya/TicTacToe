#Tic Tac Toe

I built this as a test project for an apprenticeship. In the process, I've attempted to keep the code clean with SOLID principles. I've also attempted to test all aspects of the project, with rspec for ruby and jasmine for the small amount of javascript.

This was built in Ruby on Rails. Clone the repo to your machine.

```
bundle install
```

Load up rails server

```
rails server
```

And that should do it.
